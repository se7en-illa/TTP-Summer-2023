You've worked diligently to learn many useful web development skills in the course of this program. In the past we've provided you with scaffolding and structure for you to feel more comfortable with the flow of making web development applications. For your final project, you will be creating an application, of your own choosing, that showcases some of the skills you've learned in this program. This is the perfect time to express your creativity.
