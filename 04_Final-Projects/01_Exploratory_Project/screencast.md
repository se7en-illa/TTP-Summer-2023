# Exploratory Project Screencast

## Breakdown

Your screencasts should focus on presenting your projects features and implementation details with your classmates in an organized fashion. See below for some topics you should to talk about when recording your video as well as some extras if you need more content.

## Timing

**The length of the video should be <= 3 minutes**

## Logistics

Presentations will be conducted in our main zoom room. I will be playing your videos in the order in which we receive them.

## What do I do / talk about in my screencast?

- What is the basic premise behind the app?
- Demonstrate how you use it
- What technology did you use? (APIs, modules, frameworks)
- What did you learn while working on it?
- Talk through any difficulties you may have had while working on it

## Extra Potential Topics

- If you had more time what would you do differently?
- Talk about and demo a feature you are most proud of
- What is a big win you had while working on this project?

## Tips

- Slow down and take your time
- Consider reading from a script if you are very nervous
- Avoid filler words like "um", "uhh", or "you know"
- You can always re-record if things go wrong
- Be patient with yourself and your mistakes
- You don't need to focus on what doesn't work, focus on what does

## What if my project is not working correctly?

This happens sometimes, however, its still an opportunity to answer the following questions:

- What was the original goal?
- Where did you go wrong?
- What would you do differently if you could do it all over again?

## Do I show my code?

You can show some code when recording but only if what you are talking about requires code to be seen to be understood. Focus most of your time on talking through what the app does from the perspective of a person using it.
