# Final Project #2 - **due by Friday at 1pm**

#### **Goals**

**To explore and have fun!** Seriously. This is an opportunity to goof off with **new technology** _without_ any specific expectations. This project can be absolutely anything you want it to be. This is meant to be “_fun and playful_.” If what you deliver is incomplete, **that’s fine**! Think of this as a very low-stakes sandbox.

The requirements for this project are very loose and are as follows:

- [ ] Your project should have the following components:
  - [ ] A homepage
  - [ ] A navbar
  - [ ] A separate component for the main part of your project
  - [ ] At least two routes
- [ ] Your frontend needs to display in the browser.
- [ ] Your github repository and video link should be posted in the Slack thread by Friday at 1pm.

For some inspiration, check out this [list of technologies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t4_R1QAsMPj3nInjkLrNZ9Wgj6OuaETHy7tH39XPrc0/edit?usp=sharing) to explore.

#### **Submissions**

Record a **short** (`<= 5` minutes) screencast and upload to YouTube as an **unlisted** video.

Your video submission does **_not_** have to be polished. **At all.** You’re **_not_** expected to show this to anyone outside of this class. Just think of it as a casual class presentation. Keep it conversational.

On the due date, we will start a thread within the cohort Slack channel.

Share the name of the technology you used, a quick description of what the technology is used for, and the link to your YouTube screencast.

- For example, Slack, "**\_D3.js - JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.**," which can foster a conversation amongst each other like so:
  - “Wow I didn’t know you could do that with D3!”
  - “Thanks, I really liked your Firebase demonstration. How’d you get that information to show up on the front end?”
