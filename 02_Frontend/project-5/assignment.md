# Pokedex Project: Part 3

<details open>
<summary><h3>Part 1: Introduction</h3></summary>

### Context and Goals

In the previous part of the Pokedex project, we created an Express application integrated with a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize. We created models, defined associations, and set up routes to interact with our data.

In this part, we will take a step further and two React components to display all Pokemon and individual Pokemon. We will be using axios in our React components to fetch the data from the backend.

### Setup

1. Fork and clone [this boilerplate repository]()
2. CD into the project directory.
3. Install your dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Run your server with `npm start`

At first, you won't see anything on the page. We need to set up our routes and components first! In previous projects, we guided you through the project step by step. This time, we will test your knowledge. Below are the requirements for this project. You are allowed to reference previous projects and your notes from class. Good luck!
