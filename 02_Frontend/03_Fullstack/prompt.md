# Fullstack App

Let's build an application that helps an administration track students and their courses.

## Backend

For students we need to keep track of:
- name
- registration id
- classes they are attending and prior classes attended

For courses we need to keep track of:
- name
- students taking the course
- prerequisite course (just one for this example and if at all)

## Frontend:

The administration should be able to:
- see all courses on one page
- see all students on one page
- view individual student information
- see courses student is taking on the individual student page
